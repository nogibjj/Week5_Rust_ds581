## Random Song Name Generator
This is a simple Rust program that generates a random name for a song with two words from a list of given words. 

## Usage
To use the program, run `cargo run` in the project directory. The program will generate a random song name and print it to the console.

You can modify the list of words used by the program by changing the WORDS array in main.rs.

Note that the program ensures that no word is repeated in the generated song name.
